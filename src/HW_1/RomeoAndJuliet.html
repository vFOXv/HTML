<h4 >ACT 1</h4>
<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>

<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<h4>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h4>

<em><small>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</small></em>

<h4>SAMPSON</h4>

Gregory, o'my word, we'll not carry coals.

<h4>GREGORY</h4>

No, for then we should be colliers.
