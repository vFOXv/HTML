<h2>Vehicle</h2>
<p>
    A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><small><small><a href="#1">[1]</a></small></small></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,<br>
    bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,<br>
    boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br>
    spacecraft.<sup><small><a href ="#2">[2]</a></small></small></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:<br>
    wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for<br>
    road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><small><small><a href = "#3">[3]</a></small></small></sup>
